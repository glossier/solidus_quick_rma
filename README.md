SolidusQuickRma
===============

A fast and somewhat sensible way (for your CSRs) to do RMA's

Installation
------------

Add solidus_quick_rma to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_quick_rma'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_quick_rma:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. 
`rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, 
then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. 
The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_quick_rma/factories'
```
